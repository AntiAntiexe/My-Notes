# Scales, Modes and Keys

## Basis of Scales

- In western music, everything is formed around the **diatonic scales**. These include 5 whole steps and 2 half steps. The seven pitches of any diatonic scale can be obtained by using a chain of 6 perfect fifths.
- The notes of a diatonic scale can be numbered from 1-7. This provides a basis for many elements within western music theory.

## Modes Within Scales

- Within the diatonic subcategory of scales, there are 7 different modes.
- Modes are types of musical scales that can be differentiated by their particular accidentals within the scales and their melodic and harmonic behaviors, which are all different between the 7 modes.
- They can be categorized into:
    - Ionian
    - Dorian
    - Phrygian
    - Lydian
    - Mixolydian
    - Aeolian
    - Locrian
- However, modes are also commonly used to differentiate the minor and major keys, referring to them also as modes.

## Keys

- A key is a scale that provides as a basis for a composition. A song that uses the particular notes of a certain scale is said to be “in the key of” that particular scale.
    - For example, if a song uses the notes of a F# major scale, then it would be said to be in the key of F#.
- A key contains a **tonic***,* and its corresponding chords. Notes that vary from the tonic create tension within a composition, which is the resolved by returning to the tonic.
- When not specified, it is usually implied that a mode is in a major key, though they can be major or minor, depending on the scale used as the key.
    - If it is said that a song is “in the key of A”, it is implied that it would be A major.
