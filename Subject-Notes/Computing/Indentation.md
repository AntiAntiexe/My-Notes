# Indentation

- A space or gap in front of the statement. They are really important for Python since Python is based on indentations. Normally use the “tab” key or space 4 times always use one of these only.
- Used to create groups of code that belong together. Shows Python which lines are part of a particular section. Idents are usually made automatically by a good IEM.
- Always indent the code inside blocks otherwise it won’t work as expected. New indents are usually used after colons (“:”)
