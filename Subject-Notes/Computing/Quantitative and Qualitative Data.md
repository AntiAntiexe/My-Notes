# Quantitative and Qualitative Data

# Quantitative Data

- Answers “When?” “How often?” “How many?” questions
- Numeric or coded
- acquired by measurement
- can be directly analysed statistically
- Usually obtained using closed questions
    - E.g. multiple, choice, limited range of answers.
- Gathered in large quantities, without much depth.
- Objective (factual, unemotional)
    - e.g. “x% of teenagers drink alchohol weekly”.
- Can be used to make comparisons with other places or times.
- Can investigate the current status of an issue.
- Acquired with Likert scales
    - Graduated scale of values (Very much, somewhat, rarely, never).
    - Numeric scale “How strongly do you believe…?”
- Multiple choice.
- Ranking
    - “Put numbers 1 to 10 beside these options to rank your favourite modes of public transport”.
- May use:
    - Radio buttons
    - Checkboxes
    - Combo boxes, drop-down lists of options.

# Qualitative Data

- Answers “Why…?” or “How…?”questions
- Descriptive answers
- expressed in words
- concerned with opinions, personal views, feelings
- must be encoded to be analysed statistically
- looks at the total picture, not tiny details
- Investigates motives, reasons, reactions, likes, dislikes
- gathered in depth, not quantity
- usually acquired using *open-ended questions*
    - *unstructured, free-form textual answers*
- subjective (opinion-based)
    - “*Why* do you drink alcohol weekly? How does it affect your life?

# Which one to use?

- When little is known about a subject, **qualitative** research can discover ideas and categories for later large-scale **quantitative** research.

| **Qualitative** | **Quantitative** |
| --- | --- |
| **Expensive** | Collect lots of data
 |
| Slow
 | Relatively cheap, quick, little labour
 |
| Labour-intensive
 | Easy to process statistically
 |
| Processing-intensive
 | Lacks depth, explanation, reasons
 |
| Rich
 | No non-verbal cues
 |
| Detailed | Less chance of people bothering to respond
 |
| Explanations, reasons, detail
 |  |
| Non-verbal information
 |  |
| Respondents more likely to cooperate
 |  |

# Acquiring Data

- Qualitative
    - Interviews
    - Observations
- Quantitative
    - Surveys
    - Questionnaires
    - Sensors

# Coding Qualitative Data

- Unstructured qualitative answers don’t easily fall into neat categories for counting, averaging.
- Answers need to be *coded* (or *encoded*).
- Coding takes human interpretation, judgement
- May introduce error, bias.
- Descriptive coding – reduces original wordiness.
- Theoretical coding – replaces ideas with symbols, labels, numbers.

# Rubric

- A set of performance criteria corresponding with marks, categories, labels.
- Guides decisions of people encoding qualitative answers.
    - E.g. English essays.
    - VCE IT outcomes.
- *33-40 marks*
    - *Thorough and insightful analysis correctly identifies all the website requirements of an online community and acknowledges all relevant technical and non-technical constraints.*
    - *All selected design tools are appropriate.*
    - *Correct design techniques are consistently applied to fully represent the functionality and appearance of a website that is feasible and accordant with the analysis.*
    - *All manual and electronic validation techniques effectively check the reasonableness of data…*
