# Solving Quadratic Equations

# Null Factor Law

- If the product of two numbers is zero, then one or both numbers must be zero.

$$
\text{a number} \times \text{another number} = 0
$$

- In the above equation, we know that a number =0 and /or another number = 0.

# Example

Solve $3x^2-27 = 0$

$$
= 3(x^2-9) = 0 \\ = 3(x^2-3^2) = 0 \\ = 3(x-3)(x+3) = 0
$$

$$
x+3 = 0 \ \text{or} \ x-3 = 0 \\ x=-3 \ \text{or} \ x = 3 
$$

Solve $x^2-13x+42=0$

| Factors of 42 | Sum of factors |
| --- | --- |
| -6 and -7 | -13 |

$$
(x-6)(x-7)=0 \\ x-6 = 0 \ \text{or} \ x-7 = 0 \\ \therefore x = 6 \ \text{or} \ x = 7
$$

# Solving quadratic equations by completing the square

## Steps to complete the square

- Factorise $x^2+6x+2 = 0$
    1. $ax^2+bx+c = 0$. Since $a=1$ in this example, we can complete. the square.
    2. Add and subtract $(\frac{b}{2})^2$. IN this example, $b=6$.
        
        $$
        x^2+6x+\color{red}{(\frac{6}{2})^2} \color{white}+2-\color{red}{(\frac{6}{2})^2} \color{white} = 0 \\ x^2+6x+9+2-9=0
        $$
        
    3. Factorise the first three terms.
        
        $$
        x^2+6x+9-7=0 \\ (x+3)^2-7 = 0
        $$
        
    4. Factorise the quadratic by using difference of two squares
    
    $$
    (x+3)^2-(\sqrt{7})^2 = 0 \ \text{because} \ (\sqrt{7})^2 = 7 \\ (x+3+\sqrt{7})(x+3-\sqrt{7}) = 0
    $$
    

# Example

Solve $x^2+2x-4 = 0$  by copmleting the square

$$
x^2+2x+1-1+4 = 0 \\ = (x+1)^2-5 = 0 \\ = (x+1)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2 = 0 \\ (x+1+\sqrt{5})(x+1-\sqrt{5}) = 0 \\ \therefore x+1+\sqrt5 = 0 \ \text{or} \ x+1-\sqrt5 = 0 \\ \therefore x=-1-\sqrt5 \ \text{or} \ x=-1+\sqrt5 
$$

# Example worded questions

When two consecutive numbers are multiplied together, the result is 20. Determine the numbers.

$$
\text{Let the two consecutive numbers be }x\text{ and } (x+1). \\ x(x+1)=20 \\x^2+x-20=0
$$

| Factors of 20 | Sum of factors |
| --- | --- |
| 5 and -4 | 1 |

$$
(x+5)(x-4)=0 \\ x+5 = 0 \text{ or } x-4 = 0 \\ x = -5 \text{ or } x = 4
$$

$$
\text{if } x = -5, \ x+1 =-4 \\ \text{if } x=4, \ x+1 = 5 \\ \text{Check: } \\ 4\times 5 = 20 \ \ \ \ (-5)\times(-4) = 20 \\ \text{The numbers are 4 and 5 or -5 and -4.}
$$

The height of a football after being kicked is determined by the formula $h=-0.1d^2+3d$, where $d$ is the horizontal distance from the player in metres.

1. Calculate how far the ball is from the player whn it hits the ground.
2. Calculate the horizontal distance the has travelled when it first reaches a height of 20m.

$$
h=-0.1d^2+3d \\ -0.1d^2+3d = 0 \\ d(-0.1d+3) = 0 \\ d=0 \text{ or } -0.1d+3 = 0 \\ -0.1d = -3 \\ d=-3/-0.1 \\ d= 30
$$

$$
d=0 \text{ is the origin of the kick.} \\ d=30 \text{ is the final distance of the kick.} \\ \therefore \text{ The ball is 30m from the player when it hits the ground.}
$$

Find the horizontal distance:

$$
20 = -0.1d^2+3d \\ -0.1d+3d-20 = 0 \\ d^2 - 30d+200 = 0 \\ (d-20)(d-10) = 0 \\ d-20 = 0 \text{ or } d-10 = 0 \\ d=20 \text{ or } d = 10 \\ \text{The ball first reaches a height of 20m after it has travelled a distance of 10m.}
$$
