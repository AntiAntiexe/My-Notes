# Completing the square

- Completing the square is the process of writing a general quadratic expression in turning point form.

- The expression $x^2+8x$ can be modelled as a square with a smaller square missing from the corner, as shown below.

- In ‘completing the square’, the general equation is written as the area of the large square minus the area of the small square.
- In general, to complete the square for $x^2+bx$, the small square has a side length equal to hald of the coefficient of x, that is the area of the small square is $(\frac{b}{2})^2$.

- The process of completing the square is sometimes described as the process of adding the square of half the coefficient of $x$ the subtracting it, as shown in purple below. The result of this process is a perfect square that is then factorised, as shown in blue.

- Here is another great example of how to do it!

# Example

Write $x^2+4x$ in turning point form by completing the square:

$$
x^2+4x = (x+2)^2-(2)^2 \\ = (x+2)^2-4
$$

Write $x^2+7x+1$ in turning point form by completing the square:

$$
x^2 +7x+1 = (x+\frac{7}{2})^2-(\frac{7}{2}) +1 \\ (x+\frac{7}{2})^2-\frac{49}{4} + \frac{4}{4} \\ = (x+\frac{7}{2})^2 - \frac{45}{4}
$$

# Factorising by completing the square

- When an equation is written in turning point form it can be factorised as a difference of two squares.
- For examole, factorise $x^2 +8x+2$ by completing the square:

# Example

Factorise $x^2+4x+2$ by completing the square

1. To complete the square, add the square of half the coefficient of x and then subtract it.
2. Write the perfect square created in its factorised form
3. Write the expression as a difference of two squares by:
    1. simplifying the numerical terms
    2. writing the numerical term as a square 
        
        $$
        (2=(\sqrt{2})^2)
        $$
        
    3. Use the pattern for DOTS,
    
    $$
    a^2-b^2= (a-b)(a+b)
    $$
    
    where
    
    $$
    a = (x+2)\ \text{and} \ b= \sqrt{2}
    $$
    

$$
= x^2+4x+(\frac{4}{2})^2-(\frac{4}{2})^2 + 2 \\ = x^2+4x+(2)^2-(2)^2 + 2 \\ = (x+2)^2-4+2 \\ = (x+2)^2-2 \\ =(x+2)^2-(\sqrt{2})^2 \\ = (x+2+\sqrt{2})(x+2-\sqrt{2})
$$
