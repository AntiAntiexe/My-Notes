# The Real Number System

- The number system used today is evolved from a basic and practical need of primitive people to count.

## Integers ($Z$)

- The set of integers consists of whole positive and negative numbers and 0.
- A set of integers is denoted by the symbol $Z$ and can be visualised as:

$$
Z = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0,1,2,3,...\}
$$

- The set of positive integers are known as the natural numbers (or counting numbers) and is denoted $Z^+$ or N.

$$
Z^+ = N= \{1,2,3,4,5,6,...\}
$$

- The set of negative integers is denoted $Z^-$

## Rational Numbers ($Q$)

- A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where b does not equal 0.
- A set of rational numbers can be represented by symbol $Q$.
- Rational numbers include **terminating decimals** which terminate after a specific number of digits, and recurring decimals which repeat a specific pattern of numbers.
- Using set notations, we can represent the set of rational numbers as:

$$
Q = \{\frac{a}{b}:a, b \in Z, b \ne 0\}
$$

- This can be read as ‘$Q$ is all numbers of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ given $a$ and $b$ is not equal to 0’.

## Irrational Numbers ($I$)

- An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $b \ne 0.$
