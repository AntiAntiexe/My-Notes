# The Discriminant

# Using the discriminant

- The discriminant is the value inside the square root sign in the quadratic formula.

## The discriminant

$$
\Delta = b^2-4ac
$$

- The symbol $\Delta$ represents the *discriminant.*
- The discriminant is found from:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\ x= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
$$

- The value of the discriminant indicates the number of solutions for a quadratic solution:
    - $\Delta < 0$: is the discriminant is negative there are no real solutions.
    - $\Delta = 0$: if the discriminant is zero there is one solution
    - $\Delta > 0$: if the discriminant is positive there are two solutions.
        - A positive discriminant that is a perfect square (16, 25, etc) gives two rational solutions.
        - A positive discriminant that is a not a perfect square (7, 11, 15, etc) gives two irrational (surd) solutions.

# Example

Find the value of the discriminant for $x^2+10-0$ and use it to determine how many solutions the equation will have

$$
=x^2+0x+10\\ \Delta = b^2-4ac \\ \Delta = 0^2-4\times1\times10 \\ \Delta = -40
$$

$$
\Delta < 0 \text{ so there will be no real solutions to the equation.}
$$

# Example

Determine whether the parabola $y=x^2-2$ and the line $y=x-3$ intersect.

$$
y = x^2-2 \\ y = x-3 \\ x^2-2 = x-3 \\ x^2-2-x+3 = 0 \\ x^2-x+1=0 \\ \Delta = (-1)^2-4\times1\times1 \\ \Delta = 1-4 \\ = -3 \\ \Delta <0, \therefore \text{ no real solutions therefore the lines do not intersect.}
