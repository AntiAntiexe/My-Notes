# Neurohormones

# Introduction:

Neurohormones are a special type of neurotransmitters, where they can be produced by the brain and the rest of the body, and can act as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter.

# Hormone vs Neurotransmitter:

### Hormone:

Hormones are chemical substances produced by glands in the body:

- influence target cells
- travel through bloodstream

### Neurotransmitter:

Neurotransmitters are  chemical messages, for communication of the brain to the body 

- communication of a target cell
- travel through distances between neurons (synapse)
- can only travel through short distances of 0.001 of a micrometer (to the neighboring neuron(s))

# Types of Neurohormones:

## Serotonin:

### What makes it a neurohormone?

sertoning is a neurohormone which is produced by special seretoning neurons, and the intestines, thus why it is a neurohormone as it is both a hromone and and a neurotransmitter 

### What is its use?

- regulated mood and sense of wellbeing
- makes u feel “good” (high mood and happiness)
- sleep regulation (alongside melatonin)
- bowel movement (esstienally getting rid of any unwanted stuff that is harming the body like food poisoning)

### What makes it special?

the abbility to be both a hormone and a neurotransmitter, and its ability to only make and impact on the brain if its from the nervous system, and on the body if its produced by the intestines

## Endorphins:

### What makes it a neurohormone?

Endorphins are neurohormones as they are both produceds by the pituitary gland in the brain and also in other prts of the body, but unlike seretonin it cant travel from blood to brain (blood brain barrier), so they are released from the synasoes ti affect neurons or blood stream for the body.

### What makes it special?

Endorphins are just natural pain killers produced by the body. For example one endorphin that is commonly produced is an enkephalin which is just a natrual version of an opiate (pain killer), which is more powerful than morphines (which is a human-made pain killer drug)

### What's its use?

To remove pain or stress from the body, for instance: when you are eating spicy food.

# Dopamine

### What makes it a neurohormone

Dopamine is the msot porminent neurohormone, where its often recognised as the “reward” hormone. Essantially its for makign us feel “good”. the reason why is a neurhormone is Being able to be produced by many areas of the brain and also many areas of the body.

### what makes it special

Dopamine is very special as its the most common occuring neurohormone which is used to make a person feel good after a pleasurable acitivy (both physical and mental). without it is linked to parkisons diases, and too much of it leads to what we call an addiction (chapter 2)
