# Reflection

# The law of Reflection

- When an incoming ray of light bounces of a plane mirrors at the same angle as the out going ray.
    - Incoming ray = incident ray
    - the ray bouncing off is called the reflected ray
    - a dotted imaginary line called the normal is shown perpendicular to the mirror and is used to measure the angle of incidence (i) and angle of reflection (r).

    - The angle of incidence if equal to the angle of reflection.
