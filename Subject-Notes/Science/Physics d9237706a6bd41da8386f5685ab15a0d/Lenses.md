# Lenses

- A lens is a transparent piece of glass, plastric or jelly which is shaped either inward or outward.

# Convex lens

- Convex lenes bulge outwars.
- They cause light rays to come together or converge at a focal point.
- Distance between the focal point and centre of the lens is called the focal length.

- Images created can be:
    - larger or smaller than the objects they represent.
    - Upright or upside down
    - real or virtual
- Larger images are formed when the object is located between the lens and the focal point.
- Smaller images are formed when the object is located more than tow focal lengths from the lens. The object will appear upside down.
- The greater the curve of the lens the stronger the lens.

# Convex Lenes

- They bulge inwards
- The cayse light to diverge but they appear to the observer as coming from one point (the focal point).
- The distance from the focal point to the centre of the lens is called the focal length.

- Images created are:
    - Small
    - upright
    - virtual
- The image formed is always smaller than the object it represents.

# Real vs Virtual Images
