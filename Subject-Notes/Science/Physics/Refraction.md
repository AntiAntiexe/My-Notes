# Refraction

- The speed of light can change through different materials
- When there is a change of speed light is travelling. It will change direction.
- Refraction is the change in direction of light as it enters a different substance.

# Refractive Index

- The refractive index is used to measure the speed of light through different substances. The higher the index of a material, the slower the light travels through the material.
- The more closely packed the particles are in a substance, the longer it will take light energy to travel through.

- The higher the refractive index, the more time light spends in the medium.
- The higher the refractive index the slower the light travels.

# Why does Refraction Occur

- When entering a substance of higher refractive index, the light will bend towards the normal.
- As the particles slow down the speed of light on one side causing it to curve inward, towards the normal.
- When entering a substance of lower refractive index, light will bend away from the normal.
- Entering a substance head on is not bent but continues straight through.

# Total Internal Reflection

- When light enters a substance of lower refractive index is that it is refracted away from the normal.
- When this angle of incidence increases it reaches a point so far along that it meets the boundary of the two substances this is the critical angle.

- When the angle of incidence is grater than the critical angle, there will be no refracted ray, light is totally reflected internally hence called total interval reflection.
