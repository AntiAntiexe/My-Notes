# Properties of Waves

![image.png](Subject-Notes/Science/Physics/Properties%20of%20Waves/image.png)

- Wavelength ($\lambda$) - distance between two crests.
- Amplitude ($\alpha$) - size of wave
- Frequency ($f$) - how often the wave repeats: 1 hz = 1 per second
- Period ($T$) - time for one repition

$$
f = \frac{1}{T} \\ f = \frac{1}{f}
