- Elements/ atoms
    
    everything is made up of atoms even the smallest things. Atoms are made up with even smaller particle called subatomic particles.
    
    There are 3 types of subatomic particles: protons, electrons and neutrons
    
    Protons: contains a positive charge
    
    electron: has a negative charge
    
    Neutron: has a neutral charge (no charge)
    
- Key terms
    1. electron shell: the outer shell of an atom 
    2. ion: a atom that bears one or more positive or negative electrical charges.
    3. electron configuration: the distribution of electrons.
    4. valence electrons: Valence electrons are electrons that located in the outermost electron shell of an atom

- how to find the electron shell configuration/ valence electrons
    
    The number of valence electrons for any atoms is equal to the number of electrons in its outmost shell.
    
    To find the number of valence electrons You can use the periodic table to help you determine how many valence electrons an element (specifically, a neutral atom of the element) has. Look at the group that the element is in, as the group number indicates the number of valence electrons that the element has.

- periodic table
    
    what is the periodic table? : 
    
    The Periodic Table is a way of listing the elements. Elements are listed in the table
    by the structure of their atoms. This includes how many protons they have as well as
    how many electrons they have in their outer shell. From left to right and top to
    bottom, the elements are listed in the order of their atomic number, which is the
    number of protons in each atom.
    
    - periodic groups and periods
        
        There are seven periods and eighteen groups in the periodic table.
        
        **Periods**
        
        Periods are the horizontal rows in the periodic table. As you move left to right across a period, the atomic number of the elements increases. This means the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom increases. Elements in the same period generally have different chemical properties because they have different electron configurations.

        **Groups**
        
        Groups are the vertical columns in the periodic table. Elements in the same group tend to have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell). These electrons are the ones most involved in forming chemical bonds.
        
        Here's a list of all the groups with a short description of each:
        
        - Group 1: Alkali metals - These are very reactive metals that readily form ionic bonds by losing one electron.
        - Group 2: Alkaline earth metals - These are reactive metals that form ionic bonds by losing two electrons.
        - Group 3-12: Transition metals - These metals have variable oxidation states and can form many different compounds.
        - Group 13-16: Main group metals - These elements tend to form covalent bonds by sharing electrons with other atoms.
        - Group 17: Halogens - These are nonmetals that are very reactive and form ionic bonds by gaining one electron.
        - Group 18: Noble gases - These are nonmetals that are unreactive because their outer electron shell is full.

    - periodic trends
        - what are periodic trends
            
            Periodic trends are patterns in elements on the periodic table. Major trends are electronegativity, ionization energy, electron affinity, atomic radius, and metallic character. The existence of these trends is due to the similarity in atomic structure of the elements in their group families or periods and because of the periodic nature of elements. These trends are readily mapped to the periodic table; however, there are numerous exceptions that exist for all the trends. This will focus on the trends alone
            
        - electronegativity
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)
            
        - ionization energy
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)
            
        - Atomic radius
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)
            
        - metallic character
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled%207.png)
            
        - electron affinity

- ions
    
    what are ions?
    
    ions are any atom with a charge (negative or positive)
    
    - what are cation and anion
        
        Usually most atoms have a neutral charge since there are equal amounts of protons and electrons. Atoms tend to lose (give to another atom) or gain electrons (negative charge) from other atoms. When they lose an electron the atoms has more positive than negative resulting in a positive charge these atoms are called cations. And when it gains an electron and there are more electron than protons the charge is negative and these ions are called anions. 
        
        how do we write these/ examples:
        
        what happens when it loses an electron:

    - polyatomic ion
        
        polyatomic ion is a group of atoms that contain a charge (positive or negative)
        
        to find out the charge of a polyatomic ion. You have to first count up every proton and electron in the ion including the ones surrounding it middle element. And then you can find it out if it is a cation or anion. 
        
        example of polyatomic ion is: NO3-
        
        The 3 oxygen molecules and connected to the nitrogen molecule and all of them have a charge of negative since we add all the protons and electrons for the 3 oxygen and 1 nitrogen.

        - covalent bonding

            instead they can share and gain an extra to fulfill thier demands for being that element.

            this allows them to bond with each other. But sometimes if one needs more electrons than the other that element takes a electron from another source giving it a extra one. If they still need more they can still bond using covalent bonding.
