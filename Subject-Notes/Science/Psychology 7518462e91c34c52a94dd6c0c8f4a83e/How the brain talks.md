# How the brain talks

## **What is a Neuron:**

- **Basic building block of our brain’s nervous system.**
- **Key cell for communication.**
- **“Enables” the ability for the brain to “talk”/communicate to the rest of the body (and vise-versa).**

## What does a Neuron look like?

![Figure 1: *shows a diagram of what a Neuron looks like.*](Subject-Notes/Science/Psychology%207518462e91c34c52a94dd6c0c8f4a83e/How%20the%20brain%20talks%20c77e64736941466d92eacadc082ffd41/Untitled.png)

**Each part of the Neuron has a different purpose in the overall purpose of the Neuron (which is for communication with the brain and the body).

## What do these parts of Neuron do and what are they?

**Dendrites**

- Branch-like extenders/extensions.
- Covered in receptors - that receive neurotransmitters (chemical responses) from other neighboring Neurons.
- Receive messages from neighboring Neurons.

Neurotransmitters

- Chemical responses which tell neurons what to do.
- can either be  an excitatory or an inhibitory (which either increase activity or decrease).

Excitatory

- Tells neurons to be more active.
- To start firing more “messages”.

Inhibitory

- Tells the neuron to “calm down” or to decrease  its activity
- To reduce firing of “messages”

Soma

- The cell body of the neuron - housing nucleus & DNA.
- Control center of the Neuron.
- sends messages from the Dendrites to the Axon

Nucleus

- Houses DNA of Neuron
- Makes sure that the Neuron is healthy, (For example: a protein synthesis).

Axon

- Cable-like extension.
- Runs from the soma to the end of a Neuron (Axon terminals).
- Covered by a layer called: Myelin sheath.

Myelin Sheath

- Fatty tissue surrounding the Axon.
- Helps with travel of chemical responses from the soma to the end of a Neuron.
- Helps insulate the Axon.

Neural impulses

- Special term given for when messages travel along a Neuron which can either be electrical and chemical.

Axon terminals

- Lie at the tip of a Neuron ( i.e. lie at the end of the Axon).
- Release neurotransmitters.
- Branch-like extensions.

Synapse

- A small gap between the neurons (As neurons do not touch each other, and communicate through neurotransmission).

## Fun Facts:

> **Neuron speed:**
> 
> 
> Neural impulse speeds vary depending on the
> neuron it is traveling through. It can range from
> less than 1 meter per second up to more than
> 100 meters per second.
> 

> **Amount of Transmitters:**
> 
> 
> There are about 1000
> neurotransmitters in the human body and each
> has a different role.
> 

> **Connections:**
> 
> 
> Each neuron is capable of making 10000 connections with
> other neurons, meaning that each single person could have
> up to 30 quadrillion connections in their brain!
> 

> **Billions of Neurons:**
> 
> 
> It is estimated that
> the brain on its own has 86 billion neurons!

## Glossary:

| **Dendrites**  | Branch-like extensions at the front end of a neuron that receive neurotransmitters from other neurons. |
| --- | --- |
| **Neurotransmitters** | Chemical messengers released by the axon that travel across the synapse (a gap) to the dendrites of neighboring neurons. |
| **Excitatory**  | A type of neurotransmitter that increases the overall activity of a neuron, making it more likely to fire. |
| **Inhibitory**  | A type of neurotransmitter that decreases the overall activity of the neuron, making it less likely to fire.
 |
| **Soma** | The cell body and control center of a neuron, containing its nucleus and DNA. |
| **DNA** | A molecule present in nearly all living things that carries the genetic information responsible for cell development and function. |
| **Axon** | A cable-like extension from the cell body of a neuron that sends messages to other neurons. |
| **Myelin sheath** | Fatty, white insulating tissue that surrounds the axons of neurons. |
| **Neural impulses** | The messages that travel along a neuron that are both electrical and chemical in nature.
 |
| **Axon terminals**  | Branch-like extensions of the axon at the end of a neuron that release neurotransmitters across the synapse to be received by other neurons. |
| **Synapse**  | A small gap between neurons. |
| **Nucleus** | The “center” of the neuron which houses DNA and also makes sure that the Neuron is healthy (by using protein synthesis) |
| **Protein synthesis** | Protein synthesis refers to the biological process whereby amino acids are assembled by peptide bonding into specific polypeptide sequences in accord with genetic blueprints encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). |
