- **1. Introduction to Cells**
    - Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things.
    - All living organisms are made up of one or more cells.
    - New cells are produced from pre-existing cells through cell division.
- **2. Microscopy**
    - Microscopes allow us to observe and study cells, which are too small to be seen with the naked eye.
    - Magnification: The process of making objects appear larger than they are.
    - Total magnification = Ocular lens magnification x Objective lens magnification.
    - Field of View: The area visible through a microscope's eyepiece when looking at a specimen.
    - As magnification increases, the field of view becomes smaller.
- **3. Key Glossary Words**
    - Magnification: The process of enlarging the appearance of an object.
    - Microscopic: Too small to be seen with the naked eye.
    - Microscope: An instrument used to magnify and view small objects.
    - Light Microscope: A microscope that uses visible light to illuminate the specimen.
    - Field of View: The area of the specimen visible through the microscope.
- **4. Cell Theory**
    1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells: This principle states that all living things, from the simplest bacteria to complex multicellular organisms, are made up of cells. Cells are the building blocks of life.
    2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in organisms: According to this principle, cells are the smallest functional and structural units of living organisms. Each cell performs specific functions necessary for the survival and functioning of the organism as a whole.(it is the smallest functional unit of all living organism)
    3. Cells arise from pre-existing cells: This principle states that cells can only be derived from pre-existing cells through cell division. Cells replicate and give rise to new cells through processes such as mitosis or meiosis.
- **5. Requirements of Cells**
    - Movement: All living things can move or respond to stimuli.
    - Respiration: The process of releasing energy from food.
    - Sensitivity: Living things sense and respond to changes in their environment.
    - Feeding: All living things need food for energy and essential substances.
    - Excretion: The removal of waste products from the body.
    - Reproduction: All living things produce offspring to ensure species survival.
    - Growth: All living things grow and increase in size.
- **6. Types of Cells**
    - Prokaryotes: Simple cells without a nucleus (e.g., bacteria).
    - Eukaryotes: More complex cells with a true nucleus (e.g., protists, fungi, plants, animals).
- **7. Cell Structures and Organelles (list of all)**
    - Nucleus: Controls cell activities and stores genetic information.
    - Cell Membrane: Controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
    - Cytoplasm: A jelly-like substance where cell activities occur.
    - Mitochondria: Generates energy through cellular respiration.
    - Endoplasmic Reticulum: Involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism.
    - Golgi Apparatus: Processes, modifies, and packages proteins.
    - Lysosomes: Contain enzymes for intracellular digestion and waste removal.
    - Vacuoles: Store various substances such as water, waste, and chemicals.
    - Chloroplasts (in plant cells): Site of photosynthesis, converting light into energy.
    - Cell Wall (in plant cells): Provides support and shape to the cell.
    - Cytoskeleton: Supports the cell and maintains its shape.
    
- **things that different types of cells have (7 but more specific)**
    
    **In Animal Cells:**
    
    - Nucleus: The central control center of the cell, housing the genetic material and regulating cell activities.
    - Cell Membrane: A selectively permeable barrier that controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
    - Cytoplasm: A gel-like substance where cellular processes occur.
    - Mitochondria: Organelles responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration.
    - Endoplasmic Reticulum: Involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism.
    - Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and transports proteins within the cell.
    - Lysosomes: Contain enzymes for intracellular digestion and waste removal.
    - Vacuoles(but is small): Smaller and more numerous in animal cells, storing various substances depending on the cell type.
    - Cytoskeleton: A network of protein filaments that maintain cell shape and support cellular movement.
    
    **In Plant Cells:**
    
    - Nucleus: The central control center of the cell, housing the genetic material and regulating cell activities.
    - Cell Membrane: A selectively permeable barrier that controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
    - Cytoplasm: A gel-like substance where cellular processes occur.
    - Mitochondria: Organelles responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration.
    - Endoplasmic Reticulum: Involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism.
    - Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and transports proteins within the cell.
    - Lysosomes: Not as common in plant cells as in animal cells.
    - Vacuoles(bigger than plants): Large and central in plant cells, storing water, nutrients, and waste products. Helps maintain cell rigidity and turgor pressure.
    - Chloroplasts: Exclusive to plant cells, sites of photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose).
    - Cell Wall: Only found in plant cells, providing structural support and protection for the cell.
    - Cytoskeleton: A network of protein filaments that maintain cell shape and support cellular movement.
