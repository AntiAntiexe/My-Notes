# Creation of an Addiction

# Introduction:

Neurons work very interestingly to communicate a bigger picture. it is with the learnign and memory that an addiction is created. Before we can go into addictions we have to focus on how we humans learn and remember (at a neural level).

# How we learn and remember

### how is a memory formed?

when new information is learned, a memory is usally formed (sometimes can last for ages and sometimes for a few seconds) on a neural level we see more expansion of dentrites (via sprouting) and growth of axon terminalsleading to stonger connections of neurons.

The
neurotransmitter glutamate is released and
its levels increase during learning, so the
changes at the synapse become longer-lasting
and more permanent. In addition to this, the
neurohormone dopamine is released.

### Why does it make us feel “good”?

When we learn somethign that makes us feel “good” this is due to release of seretonin and other neurhormones, this is because seretonin lifts up our mood and the endorphins (which are usually painkillers) makes us feel good. Where as dopamien and glutamates help form the memory of the thign that made us feel good. This means when we wanna feel good, we are more likely do a behaviour that we have done before that makes us feel good which essaintially causes an addiciton

Note: not all plreasuable activies form what we typically think of as an addiction, but mroe for the sake of doign things we may enjoy liek eatign/makign good food or creating music, or doing good in a test
