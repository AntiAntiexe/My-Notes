# About this page

This page is made a little differently than other pages on this project. For example: use of short paragraphs and colour coordination for certain aspects which help the reader know what is important and what may not be as important. (anton pls üôè)

# Colour:

- Default - Normal text, Used for headings (1) for paragraphs
- Grey - Used for Fact/quote tittles, for headings (2) of sub-sub-headings (3), and for showing what a figure is describing
- Brown - used for comparison paragraphs between 2 or more fact
- Orange - used for words that are  meanings described in the glossay

# Text - choices

In this page we decided to use default font (for now Anton üôè) and used short paragraphs as bullet points don't all ways work (but is been used as much as possible to keep it short and simple)

# Questions

in this page we decided to add questions for each minor/sub topic to make sure readers truly understand what they are reading about. Alongside these, we do offer answers for each of these questions and points on where it is shown in the page to go read once more.
