# Death of a Neuron

## Introduction:

Neurons like many other cells, can die. it’s not a problem in small numbers but there are scenarios where vast amounts are well “killed”. There are two likely possibilities ( biological conditions) for that and that is what we will be reviewing today.

## Multiple sclerosis:

### What is it?

Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disease, mostly affecting young adults. it attacks the myelin sheath (fatty tissue surrounding the axons of a neuron). 

### How does it happen?

Most commonly belief/study shows that it is likely due to the fact that the immune system mistakenly starts to attack the myelin sheath causing damages to the axon.

### Why does it happen?

The disease is idiopathic and has no known cause of origin, but the likelihood of getting is increased by genetics,  viral infections, and depending on how far you live from the equator.

### Why is it a problem?

The damages to the myelin sheath  causes the axon to be exposed which alters the communication process, essentially slowing or stopping the brain communication.

## Next wave:

Usually the myelin sheath will end up growing back, which means that the Neuron will go back to normal, but with MS these “waves” can come back meaning even after recovery. This means that people with MS will get repeated damage to their Neurons which can affect its communication in the brain

## Symptoms of MS:

- coordination issues
- loss of motor function (e.g. weakened control of a hand or an arm)
- speech problem
- extreme fatigue
- vision problems
- tremors (physical trembling/weakening)
- discomfort/pain
- alterations in ability to think and remember
- loss of sensation
- tingling feeling in skin

## Acquired brain injury:

### What is it?

As the name suggests it is when sustained damage is done to the brain causing damages to the communication and functionality.

### Why does it happen?

Usual causes are when a person occurs some sort of sustained damage to  their brain due to some sort of accident (e.g. a person may acquire a brain injury due to a car accident).

### Why is it a problem?

Just like MS, sustained damage to the brain is very harmful. the force of the injury causes axons of neurons to break or weaken (as Axons are very fragile). A neuron with severed or damaged Axons will have the same trouble of communication with other neurons

## Brain plasticity

with injuries to the axons, the axons will start to become more excitable meaning as a “last ditch effort” they will try to seek out other neurons. This process is called brain plasticity, where the brain tries to overcome the damages.

### Why does this help/work?

As stated before the axons will become more excitable/acting causing other neurons to receive the transmission, which then leads to the recovery of the damage

### Side affects of recovery:

due the intense amount of activity and excitedness of neurons, it is common for people to have muscle spasms and agitation

### what is done to prevent pain?

Doctors will often give sedatives which help bring down excitedness of neurons to make sure patient is comfortable and free of pain

## Fun Facts:

> Neuron Research
> 
> 
> Swedish researchers built the world’s first artificial
> neuron in 2015. These artificial neurons are the
> size of a fingertip (so quite a bit bigger than our
> naturally occurring neurons, which we are not able
> to see) and are able to mimic the main functions
> of a neuron, such as communicating with other
> cells. This research has profound implications
> for the treatment of neurological diseases and
> brain damage, as well as the heightening and
> strengthening of the brain’s capabilities, such as
> increasing memory storage.

> Greek term

> It is thought
