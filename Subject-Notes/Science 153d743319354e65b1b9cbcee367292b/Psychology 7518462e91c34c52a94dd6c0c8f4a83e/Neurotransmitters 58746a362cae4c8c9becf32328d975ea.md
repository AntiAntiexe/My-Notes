# Neurotransmitters

# Introduction:

Neurons are responsible for all communication in the brain and the body. They do this by using one of the thousand neurotransmitters. In this page we will be looking at glutamates, aspartates, and GABA.

# Glutamates:

### What are they?

Glutamates are the most common (in the Central nervous system) of many types of  neurotransmitters that neurons release to communicate. Nearly half of all neurons in the brain can release them.

### What is the use?

- plays a role in memory and learning
- increase activity of a neuron (excitatory transmitter)

### Why is it important?

Essentially without it or lack of it, can cause problems with memory and amount of information we can take in. Though we need glutamate, too much of it can cause overstimulation (too much activity) and start to wear out.

# Aspartates:

### What are they?

Aspartates are the next most common excitatory neurotransmitters, which is just as important as glutamate in its ability to make the CNS active and working.

### What is the use?

- keeps the mind sharp and focused when needed
- promotes the use of metabolism
- assisting transportation of essential minerals to the cells (in the CNS)

### Why is it important?

As stated before, it helps the cells in the nervous system be healthy and keeps our mind focused when needed. it is also responsible for preventing depression and chronic fatigue.

### How does it help?

Aspartates are used medically to help patients which face mental health problems such as the ones stated before (chronic fatigue and depression), as it can be both produced by the body and also through products such as:  Dairy, Poultry, beef, and sugar cane.

It can also help people suffering from eating disorders or malnutrition, as these ppl lack aspartates which then leads to lack of concentration

# Acetylcholine:

### What are they?

Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter to be discovered (1936) and is another common excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system.

### What is the use?

- muscle contraction
- “movement” (motor neurons)
- clear thinking, learning, and memory

### Why is it important?

without it, or a lack of it can cause mental issue related to not being able to think properly or perceive information. For example: Alzheimer's ( a form of dementia)

# Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA):

### What are they?

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitters in the nervous system. It is an important neural partner to glutamates

### What is the use?

- reduces activity of neurons
- calms down the nervous system

### Why is it important?

 Without it or a lack of it can cause higher stress levels for longer periods of time, which then leads to a larger risk of anxiety disorders.
