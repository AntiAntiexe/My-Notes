# What is it and why is it a problem?

## what is it?

Alcohol is the most used drug in many countries (including Australia) where over 79% of adults above the age of 18  drink on a regular to occasional basis.

## Affects of alcohol

### Long term affects:

- alcoholism (dependency on alcohol)
- liver cirrhosis
- brain damage
- heart damage
- cancers
- stroke
- injuries derived from alcohol (e.g. drunk driving)

### short term affect:

- feeling relaxed
- slowed down activity (motor and memory)
- causing a rapid amount of dopamine released  (causing associations with happiness and rewards with drinking, causing the feeling of relaxed and pleasured)
- release of endorphins and serotonin (which make the drinker feel “good”)
- amplified impact of GABA (which makes u feel calm)

## Why does it become a problem?

### Blackouts:

though the short term effects seem to be okay, and not damaging to your health but over drinking can be caused when regular habits are formed. This is called binge drinking, these over drinking habits can cause black outs and small  periods of amnesia, this due to the limited activity of glutamate, which means glutamate cant make any long term changes, as at a synapse level where a memory is formed. Essentially lack of glutamate means lack of memories being formed which causes periods of amnesias

### Coordination:

Another factor with excessive drinking, is the loss of coordination and slowed reaction time (along side toughs are nausea vomiting and death). this is because alcohol is a depressant drug which slows down the function of the brain and nervous system, and with more and more consumption causes more and more health risks which end up leading to alcohol poising and death
