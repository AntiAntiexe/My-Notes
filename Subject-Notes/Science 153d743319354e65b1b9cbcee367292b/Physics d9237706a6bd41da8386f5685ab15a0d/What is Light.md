# What is Light

- A particle of light is a photon. It is electromagnetic radiation. It travels as a transverse waver. It does not require a medium to transmit through, it can pass though a vacuum.

# The visible spectrum

- Is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that the human eye can see.
- Wavelengths between 380nm to 780nm

# Luminous vs Non-luminous

- Objects that release or emit photons are to be luminous. Objects that do not release photons are called non-luminous. You can see these objects as they reflect light.

# Reflection: regular vs diffuse

## Regular

- Is on a plane mirror or any other surface that produces a reflected image.

## Diffuse

- is on any surface that we cannot see does not reflect an image.
