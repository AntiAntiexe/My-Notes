# Plane Mirror

- A flat mirror is also called a plane mirror.
- The image that forms is identical but it is revered side ways.
- Right will appear left and vice versa, this is called lateral inversion.

# Form an Image

- When a plane mirror produces an image of an object, it looks like it positions inside or behind the mirror.
- This is called the virtual image.
- This occurs as some light hits the mirror and reflects into your eyes, you see it as though the light has travelled in a straight line from the mirror. This forms the virtual image.

# Virtual Image

- The virtual image seen will be:
    - upright
    - same size
    - laterally inverted
    - appears to be located as far inside as is in front.
