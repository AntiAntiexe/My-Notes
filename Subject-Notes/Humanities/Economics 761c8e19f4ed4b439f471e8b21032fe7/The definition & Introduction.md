# The definition & Introduction

# Economics:

- Economics is all about the study of human behavior, how individuals, families, business and governments make choices on how to use their limited resources to make what they need and want come true, as well as improving their living standards

# It’s all around us:

Economics is all around us, and every day we make decisions involving choices which using our limited resources, how we use it, and how much we use it. For example  →

Along side stuff like decisions and choices, economics will also go into  production, consumption and distribution of good and services 

- Should you and your friends go to a concert , or just stay at home?
- should you continue your education or just get a job?
- Is it better to produce mobile phones, wool, hamburgers, shoes, or uranium?
- should we be able to mine in the great barrier reef and in Aboriginal sacred land for great money, or should we respect and value the cultural significance and environment more highly?

# What we will be going through

In economics we go through a lot of interesting fields such as:

- environmental economics
- the economics of international trade
- economic history
- the economics of health, education, welfare or population

Along side that we will be looking at how Australia manages its distribution, production and consumptions of good and services, and how it links to what satisfies our needs and wants.
