# Data Integrity

If data has integrity it is accurate, internally consistent and free from corruption. This means the data are reliable and trustworthy.

Unreliable data means unreliable information.

# Accurate

- Exactly or closely representing the true state of reality.
- Not being incorrect

## Note

Being precise is *different* to being accurate. Precision refers to the amount of detail that is in the information, and how consistent the data is.

## Example

It is accurate to say that Nicolas Cage is a bad actor. It is *precise* to say that he has been a bad actor in **121** movies.

# Authentic

- Authentic data comes from the source it claims. It is not deliberately or accidentally attributed to an incorrect source.
- Inauthentic data are often generate to deceive or persuade people into believing a desired “fact” or interpretation of facts.
- Authentic data may have been modified since its collection (e.g. to cleanse it) but it has not been corrupted by malicious modifications (e.g. selective deletions or “enhancements”) to alter its original meaning.

# Correct

- Correct data does not contain errors.
- The difference between accuracy and correctness makes for a good philosophical discussion.
- A common perspective is:
    - Accuracy refers to how exactly data reflects the truth on a scal. Data may be very accurate, more accurate, mostly accurate etc.
    - Correctness is more of a true/false condition: data is either correct or it is not based on some accepted rule of what is right or wrong.
- Therefore, there are various degrees of accuracy, but only two possible states of correctness.

# Reasonable

- Reasonable data fit within acceptable, commonsense parameters (limits) or they satisfy specified criteria.
- What is “reasonable” depends on circumstances and context.
- Reasonableness checks may be done during data validation to exclude certain data from subsequent processing.
- E.g.
    - It may prove to be *correct* that Jim Smith of grade 3 is twenty-five years old, but it’s not *reasonable*.
    - in a list of baby gifts, a teddy bear is reasonable; a carving knife is not.

# Relevant

- Relevant data has a close connection to the issue being studied.
- It offers meaningful and appropriate assistance to understanding a subject, and helps its users make accurate decisions.
- Data may be **irrelevant** if it
    - Relates to a different topic, e.g.
        - *Mum, why can’t I go to Paul’s party?*
        - *Because you know Paul’s mother hates me.*
    - Pertains to a time, place or conditions that don’t match the case in question:
        - *No you can’t have a mobile phone. Your grandfather never had one and **he** turned out very well.*
        - *We should be allowed to have guns. They can have them in America.*

# Timely

- Means “available when needed” or “coming at the right time”.
- If data is only available after it was needed, it would be untimely if it had become useless or irrelevant.

# How to preserve data integrity

## NEW DATA BEING ADDED

- must be validated
- remove duplicates
- Back it up

## DATA - IN USE

- use **access control** to prevent improper access or misuse
- maintain an **audit trail** to track usage
- remove data that has become irrelevant or outdated
- remove or reexamine data that came from sources that are now dubious (e.g. convicted stars, disgraced politicians)

## DATA - AFTER USE

- should be archived (just in case it’s needed later for other reasons)
- original data must be *securely* deleted (wiped, not just put into recycle bin)
- paper copies should be shredded, not binned
- discarded disks should be reformatted or destroyed

# Consequences of losing data integrity

- All information derived from the data comes under suspicion. What can be trusted? What cannot?
- Decisions based on the data become unreliable.
- Planning becomes unsure or dangerous.

- Projects based on dodgy data may fail.
- The information and organisation that created it lose trust, credibility, respect, and persuasiveness.
- Product recalls.
- Lawsuits for breach of contract.
