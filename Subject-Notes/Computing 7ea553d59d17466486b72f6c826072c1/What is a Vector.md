# What is a Vector

A vector is magnitude plus direction. They can start at any point in the coordinate space. E.g. if we had 5 kph but no direction that would not be a vector, but if we say 5 kph due east this is now a vector and we would say velocity instead of speed.

We can visualize this by saying that the vector will be 5 units east, and east will be going to the right.

It does not matter where the vector starts as long as the x and y values are the same the vector is the same.

# Notation

A vector is usually represented with variable with an arrow on top of it. 

$$
\vec{V} = \begin{bmatrix}  5\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is because we moved 5 units horizontally and zero units vertically. Think of it as regular coordinates (x, y) x goes first then y.

The pink could be another vector, lets call it $a$, then we need to find the x and y values. So it moved 3 units east, and 4 units north. We write this as:

$$
\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix}  3\\ 4\end{bmatrix}
$$

As something extra if we use the Pythagorean theorem we can see that the magnitude (or length of the vector) is 5.
