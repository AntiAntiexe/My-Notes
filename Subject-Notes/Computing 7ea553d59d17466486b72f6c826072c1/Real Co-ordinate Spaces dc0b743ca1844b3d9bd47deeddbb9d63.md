# Real Co-ordinate Spaces

# Real Two-Dimensional Coordinate Space

The real 2-dimesnional c-ordinate space is all possible real valued 2-tuples. A tuple is an ordered list, so by saying a 2-tuple means that there is 2 real numbers inside an ordered list. This is written with a capital r to the power of 2.

$$
\R^2
$$

Where the $\R$ represents that it is a real coordinate space and the 2 tells us that it is two dimensions. 

An example of a two tuple:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}  3\\ 4\end{bmatrix}
$$

And order matters, that 2-tuple is different to:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}  4\\ 3\end{bmatrix}
$$

So this can include negative numbers as well as they are real numbers. Including the vector 0, 0. A vector can start in any position in the real coordinate space.

# Real Three-Dimensional Coordinate Space

This is all real values 3-tuples. This can be written as:

$$
\R^3
$$

An example of a 3-tuple:

$$
\vec{X} = \begin{bmatrix}  5\\ 0\\7\end{bmatrix}
$$

And if we were to represent this in set notation:

$$
\vec{X} \in \R^2
$$
