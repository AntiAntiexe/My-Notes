# Why is data and information important?

- Organisations cannot conduct business without data.
    - Financial transactions
    - Customer information
    - Supplier information
    - Previous actions taken
    - Tax information

## Without Data

- Could not contact clients
- Could not keep track of expenses
- Could not manage debts, incomes
- Could not satisfy tax laws
- Would not know what stock they had
- Could not manage employees’ time, jobs or wages

# Value of Information

- Information is valuable if it is:
    - Accurate
    - Verifiable
    - Complete
    - Unbiased
    - Up-to-date
    - Relevant

# Efficient Production of Data

- Data
    - Raw, unprocessed, discrete (separate), unordered facts and figures.
    - unprocessed observations of reality.
- Information
    - Data that has been processed to yield knowledge that can be understood and used by humans.

## Note

**Warning:** information may be unreliable because its data has been processed...

- badly (e.g. using a mode average instead of a mean),
- dishonestly (e.g. cherrypicking data to prevent conclusions those that don't support the processor's point of view)
- incompetently (e.g. confusing one set of data with another)
- lazily (e.g. not finding all relevant data and only using what can be easily found)
- without attribution (not saying where the original data came from)
- using worthless data from an irrelevant time and/or place
