# Syntax Errors and Comments

# Syntax Errors

- Syntax errors are types of error that will appear when you have written something incorrectly based on syntax.
- They are errors in how you have written or structured your program
- They are usually the easiest to spot as an interpreter will notify you of the mistakes.

# Comments

- When writing code you should add comments to your work so that you can remind yourself later on what a section of code means.
- Sometimes looking at a lot of code can be complicated so it may be useful to add descriptive comments to help yourself and others who may be reading your code.
- The line of commentary in a line of text that the computer will not read as code. The computer will ignore the line and move to the next like of code.

## How to Write Comments

- To write single line comments:

```python
# A single line comment using a hashtag
```

- However, if you want to write a large amount of text use:

```python
"""
Multi line block comment
		- It can span many lines
		- And the interpreter won't try and compile it!
"""
```
