# Variables

- In programming, variables are like a box that contains things each box, holds data inside
- The data can always be taken out and change for something else.

```python
x = 5
```

- Single equal sign *(=)* is used for assigning data to a variable and *==* is checking if it is equal to this or not.
- += (adds right to left) eg. x += y ouput x+y
- it can work with “-” (subtract), “/” (divide) and “*” (multiple)

```python
x = "hello "
y = "kael"
x += y
print(x)
```

```python
hello kael
```

```python
#another way of showing this
x = "hello "
x += "kael"
print(x)

#output:
hello kael
```

```python
hello kael
```

```python
#it is basically doing is this but shorter
x = "hello "
x = x + "kael"
print(x)
```

```python
hello kael
```

# Naming Variables

- Rules about variables:
    - The first character cannot be a number
    - No spaces in the variable (use _ or camel casing)
    - Use keywords specific to the programming language
    - Can only use a-z, 0-9, and only special character that can be used is the "_"

```python
message_greeting = "Hello"
print(message) 
```

```python
Hello
```
