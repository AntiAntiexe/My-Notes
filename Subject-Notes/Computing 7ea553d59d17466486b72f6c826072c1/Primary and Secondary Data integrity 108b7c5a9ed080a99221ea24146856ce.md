# Primary and Secondary Data integrity

# What is Objective data?

- Fact based, unemotional, and gained by measurement.
- Should be used where possible

# What is Subjective data?

- Opinion based. Gained by interview, survey etc.
- Useful for criteria that won’t be measured.

# Primary and Secondary Data

## Primary

- Data collected by the user of the data. Not collected or pre-processed by other people.
- It is more reliable because its user knows exactly how it was gathered and handled.
- Expensive and slow.
- Sources:
    - Personal observations
    - Automated sensors
    - Interviews, surveys questionnaires
    - diaries

## Secondary

- Collected by other people it may be accurate, complete and unbiased, but it might not be true.
- Sources:
    - Internet (e.g. Google, Wikipedia, corporate websites, blogs, HowStuffWorks)
    - Textbooks, encyclopaedias
    - Journals, magazines, newspapers, TV
    - Government reports and publications
    - Consultants, experts, loud-mouthed fools
    - Special interest groups (e.g. churches, Greenpeace, Free Tibet, Right To Life)
    - Beware of **bias**.

# Dubious Sources

- Organisations or people with a **vested interest** in the issue
- i.e. they stand to gain or lose from the issue
- E.g. Will a car maker say their new vehicle sucks?
- Information *may* be valuable if taken with a grain of salt, e.g. a church’s information on abortion.
