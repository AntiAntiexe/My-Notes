# What is a Series?

- A series is a one dimensional, labeled array that can store a single column of any data type.
- You can think of it as a vector or a list with labels.
- A series has an index, which can be labels, numbers, or a combination of both. You can create a series from various sources, such as lists, dictionaries, scalars or files.
