# Print Function

- You have to have strings when printing, or a varibale containing a string.

```python
print("Hello, World")
```

```python
Hello, World
```

- When you do *print(”Hello, World”)* it prints something to the python console such as *Hello, World* in this case.
- There are some useful tools when printing large blocks of text:
    - */t* makes a tab/ length space in front
    - */n* makes a new line
