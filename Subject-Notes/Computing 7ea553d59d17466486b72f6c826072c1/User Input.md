# User Input

# User input in C++

- You have already learnt that `cout` is used to output values, now we are going to use `cin` to get user input.
- `cin` is a variable the reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator `>>`.

```cpp
int x; 
cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; // Display the input value
```

```powershell
Type a number: 7
Your number is: 7
```
