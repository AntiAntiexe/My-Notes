# Applying Index Laws

# Compound Interest

- One of the best practical applications of indices is compound interest.
- Compound interest is the type of interest that is applied to savings in a bank account, term deposits and bank loans.
- Unlike simple interest which has a fixed amount of interest added to each payment, compound interest depends on the balance (or principle) of the account. This means that the amount of interest increases with each successive payment. It is usually calculated per year (per annum or p.a.)
- In the following graph, it shows how compound interest increases over time. Each interest amount is 20% of the previous balance. As the balance grows, the interest increases and the balance growtrh accelerates.

- The amount to which the initial investment rows is called the compounded value or future value.

## The Compound Interest Formula

- For any investment or loan, the balance after $n$ compounding periods is given by:

$$
A = P(1+r)^n
$$

- Where:
    - $A$ is the future value of the investment in $.
    - $P$ is the principal (initial value of the investment) in $.
    - $r$ is the interest rate per compounding period as a decimal. (*Note:* The pronumeral $i$ can also be used in the formula to represent the interest rate).
    - $n$ is the number of compounding periods.
- The interest, $I$, can then be calculated using the formula:

$$
I=A-P
$$

## Example

William has $14 000 to invest. he invests the money at 9% p.a. for 5 years with interest compounded annually.

1. Use the formula $A = P(1+r)^n$ to calculate the amount to which this investment will grow.
2. Calculate the compound interest earned on the investment.

Question 1:

$$
P = \$14 \ 000, \ r = 0.09, \ n = 5 \\ A= 14 \ 000 \times 1.09^5 \\ = \$21 \ 540.74
$$

Therefore the investment will grow to $21 540.74.

Question 2:

$$
I = A-P \\ \hspace{21mm}= 14 \ 000 - 21 \ 540.74 \\ \hspace{5mm} = 7540.74
$$

Therefore the compound interest earned in $7540.74.

## Compounding Period

- In the previous example, interest is paid annually. However, interest may also be paid more regularly â†’ it may be paid six-monthly (twice a year), quarterly (4 times a year), monthly or even daily.
- The frequency of interest payment is called the compounding period.

### Calculating $n$ and $r$ for different compounding time periods

- $n$ is the total number of compounding periods

$n =$ number of years $\times$number of compounding periods per year

- $r$ is the interest rate per compounding time period:

$$
r = \frac{\text{interest rate per annum}}{\text{number of compounding periods per year}}
$$

## Example

Calculate the future value of an investment of $4000 at 6% p.a. for 2 years with interest compounded quarterly.

$$
\text{First we need to use the compound interest formula:} \\ A = P(1+r)^n \\ P = 4000 \\ n=2\times 4 = 8 \\ r = \frac{6}{4} \div 100 = 0.015 \\ A= 4000\times 1.015^8 \\ = 4505.97 \\ \text{The furture value of the investment is \$4505.97}
$$
