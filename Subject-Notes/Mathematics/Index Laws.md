# Index Laws

# First Index Law

- When terms with the same base are multiplied, the indices are added.

$$
a^{m}\times a^{n} = a^{m+n}
$$

# Second Index Law

- When terms with the same base are divided, the indices are subtracted.

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}
$$

# Third Index Law

- Any term (excluding 0) with an index of 0 is equal to 1.

$$
a^0=1, a\ne0
$$

# Fourth Index Law

- When a power $a^m$ is raised to a power, the indices are multiplied.

$$
(a^m)^n=a^{mn}
$$

# Fifth Index Law

- When the base is a product, raise every part of the product to the index outside the brackets.

$$
(ab)^m=a^mb^m
$$

# Sixth Index Law

- When the base is a fraction, raise both the numerator and the denominator to the index outside the brackets.

$$
(\frac{a}{b})^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m}
$$
