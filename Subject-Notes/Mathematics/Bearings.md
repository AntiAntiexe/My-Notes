# Bearings

# Using Bearings

- A bearing gives the direction of travel from one point or object to another.
- The bearing of B from A tells how to get to B from A. A compass rose would be drawn at A.

- To draw the bearing of A from B, a compass rose would be drawn at B.

# Compass Bearings

- A compass bearing (e.g. N40°E or S72°W) has three parts:
    - The first part is either N or S (north or south)
    - The second part is an acute angle.
    - The third part is either E or W (for east or west).
- For example the compass bearing S20°E means start by facing south and then turn 20° towards the east. This is the direction of travel.

# True Bearings

- true bearings are measured from north in a clockwise direction and are expressed in 3 digits.
- The diagram below show the bearing of 025° true. You can write this as 025°T.

# Example

A boy walks 2km on a true bearing or 090° and then 3km on a true bearing of 130°.

1. Calculate how far east of the starting point the boy is at the completion of his walk, correct to 1 decimal place.
2. Calculate how far south of the starting point the boy is at the completion of his walk, correct to 1 decimal place.
3. To return directly to his starting point, calculate how far the boy must walk and on what bearing. Write your answers in km correct to 2 decimal places and in degrees and minutes correct to the nearst minute.

1   First draw the diagram.

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{O}{H} \\ \sin(50°) = \frac{x}{3} \\ x = 3\sin(50°) \\ \approx 2.3 km
$$

The boy is 4.3km east of the starting point.

2 Distance south = $y$km

$$
a^2 = c^2 - b^2 \\ y^2 = 3^2 - 2.3^2 \\ = 9 - 5.29 \\ = 3.71 \\ y = \sqrt{3.71} \\ = 1.9 km
$$

The boy is 1.9km south of the starting point.

$$
z^2 = 1.9^2 +4.3^2 \\ = 22.1 \\ z = \sqrt{22.1} \\ \approx 4.70km
$$

$$
\tan{\alpha} = \frac{4.3}{1.9} \\ \alpha = \arctan(\frac{4.3}{1.9}) \\ = 66.16125982° \\ = 66°9'40.535'' \\ = 66°10'
$$

$$
\beta = 360°- 66°10' \\ = 293°50'
$$

The boy travels 4.70 km on a bearing of 293°50 T.
