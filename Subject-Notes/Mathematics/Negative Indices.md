# Negative Indices

# Seventh Index Law

- When a term is raised to a negative index, it is equivalent to 1 over the original term with a positive index.

$$
a^{-1}= \frac{1}{a^n}
$$

# Example

Simplify $(\frac{2m^3}{n^{-2}})^{-2}$

$$
= \frac{2^{-2}m^{-6}}{n^4} \\ =\frac{1}{2^2m^6n^4} \\ = \frac{1}{4m^6n^4}
$$
