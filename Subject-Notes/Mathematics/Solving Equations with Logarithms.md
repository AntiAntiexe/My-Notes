# Solving Equations with Logarithms

- The equation $\log_a(y) = x$  is an example of a general logarithmic equation. You can use the logarithmic laws to solve these equations.

# Example

Solve for x: $\log_2(x)=3$

$$
2^3 = x \\ x = 8
$$

Solve for x: $\log_3(x^4)= -16$

$$
4\log_3(x) = -16 \\ \log_3(x) = -4 \\ 3^{-4} = x \\ x=\frac{1}{3^4} \\ = \frac{1}{81}
$$

Solve for x: $\log_5(x-1)=2$

$$
5^2 = x-1\\25+1=x\\x=26
$$

Solve for x $\log_9(3) = x$

$$
\log_9(3)=x \\ 9^x = 3 \\ (3^2)^x = 3 \\ 3^{2x} = 3^1 \\ 2x = 1 \\ x = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Solve for x $\log_2(4)+\log_2(x)-\log_2(8) = 3$

$$
\log_2(\frac{4x}{8})=3 \\ 2^3 = \frac{x}{2} \\ x = 2 \times 2^3 \\ = 2 \times 8 \\ = 16
$$
