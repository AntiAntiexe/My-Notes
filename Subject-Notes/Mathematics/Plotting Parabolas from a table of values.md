# Plotting Parabolas from a table of values

# Plotting Parabolas

- The graphs of quadratic relationships are called parabolas.
- With a table of values you can substitute the x-values into the equation to obtain the corresponding  y-values.

- E.g. the graph of $y=x^2$ shown has been produced by generating a table of values:

- A parabola can be labelled the same way a linear graph can be labelled.

# Shapes of Parabolas

- Parabolas with the shape U are aaid to be ‘concave up’ and have a minimum turning point.
- Parabolas with the shape ∩ are said to be ‘concave down’ and have a maximum turning point.

# Example

Plot the graph of each of the following equations. In each case, use the values of x shown as the values
in your table. State the equation of the axis of symmetry, the coordinates of the turning point and the
y-intercept for each one.

1. $y=x^2+2 \text{ for } -3\le x \le3$

	

| x | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y | 11 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 11 |

The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 0$.

The turning point is $(0,2)$.

The y-intercept is 2.

1. $y=-x^2 \text{ for } -3\le x \le 3$

 

| x | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0  | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y | -9 | -4 | -1 | 0 | -1 | -4 | -9 |

The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x=0$.

The turning point is $(0,0)$.

The y-intercept is 0.
