# Solving Graphically

- To solve quadratic equations, look at the graph of $y = ax^2+bx+c$.
- The solutions are the x-intercepts, where the graph ‘cuts’ the x-axis.
- The number of x-axis intercepts will indicate the number of solutions.

    - The graph does not have any x-intercepts.

# Examples

Find the solutions for $x^2+x-2=0$ by inspecting the graph:

As you can see from the graph, the solutions are $x=-2$  and $x = 1.$

Find the solutions for $2x^2+4x-5 = 0$ by inspecting the graph:

As you can see from the graph, the solutions are $x\approx-0.9$ and $x \approx 2.9$.
