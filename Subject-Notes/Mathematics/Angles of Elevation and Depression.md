# Angles of Elevation and Depression

# Angle of Elevation

- Consider the points A and B, where B is at a higher elevation than A.
- If a horizontal line is drawn from A as shown, Forming the angle $\theta$, then $\theta$ is called the angle of elevation of B from A.

# Angle of Depression

- If a horizontal line is drawn from B, forming the angle $\alpha$, then $\alpha$ is called angle of depression of A from B.

# Alternate Angle Rule

- Because the horizontal lines are parallel, $\theta$ and $\alpha$ have the same size (alternate angles).

# Example

From a point P, on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of a tree is 50°. If P is 8 metres from the tree, determine the height of the tree correct to 2 decimals places.

$$
\tan(50°) = \frac{h}{8} \\ h = 8\tan(50°) \\ \approx 9.53m
